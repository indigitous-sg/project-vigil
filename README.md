# Project Vigil

This project comprises a interactive voice recording (IVR) backend and mobile/web application frontend that can be used by organisations that run phone hotlines.

## Description

When a phone call is received but not answered, the caller is guided through a series of interactive steps to leave a message of a number to call back.

Team members are then updated in real-time about calls received through a mobile/web app.

See READMEs in backend and frontend folders for more information and running instructions.
